# randomStrMsg

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

```npm
npm install -g randomStrMsg
```

# Usage

```Bash
randomStrMsg
```

# Contributing
If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [randomStrMsg](https://github.com/oskrobot/randomStrMsg)
